Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value describing a range of integers. Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range, inclusive of the endpoints.

Note: A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g. .

For example, the range is  and , inclusive. There are three square integers in the range:  and .

Function Description

Complete the squares function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of square integers in the inclusive range from  to .

squares has the following parameter(s):

a: an integer, the lower range boundary
b: an integer, the uppere range boundary
Input Format

The first line contains , the number of test cases.
Each of the next  lines contains two space-separated integers denoting  and , the starting and ending integers in the ranges.

Constraints



Output Format

For each test case, print the number of square integers in the range on a new line.
